        <p>
          I am a motivated and self-taught software engineer with hands-on
          experience in building full-stack applications using JavaScript,
          TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and React. I have developed and deployed
          a performance-tracking app for students, integrating robust backend
          logic with user-friendly interfaces. With a background in industrial
          engineering and business administration, I bring a structured,
          analytical approach to problem-solving and development.
